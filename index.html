        <h3>By Harry.P</h3>

        <p id="white">Due to the recent payout changes, <strong>Unity</strong> has fallen from being a reliable game
                engine</p>
        <p>Now, people are debating who will be a better substitude for <strong>Unity</strong></p>
        <p>Me personally, <strong>Godot</strong> has been a great starter engine for newbies like me.</p>
        <p>However, <strong>Unreal</strong> is also a great engine </p>
        <p>In this blog, we discuss on which game engine is going to be the best overall and part their history</p>

        <h2><em><strong>1.Unity</strong></em></h2>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Unity</strong> has been around since the 8th of June, 2005,
                aiming to "democratize" game development by making it accessible to more developers.</p>
        <p>It was shown at Worldwide Developers Conference 2005 by Scott Forstall on Mac OS X.</p>
        <p>The following year, Unity was named runner-up in the Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category in Apple
                Inc's Apple Design Awards.</p>
        <p>Initially released for Mac OS X, <strong>Unity</strong> was later adding support for Microsoft
                Windows and Web browsers</p>
        <p>Since its release,<strong>Unity</strong> has had multiple versions to keep up with the bugs found.
        </p>
        <p>So with such a rich history, why do people no longer trust it?</p>
        <p><strong>Simple. The new payout plan</strong></p>
        <img
                src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v509DtE9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sdc5vlfuoxik1qu9eyb2.png">
        <p>Now, a huge distrust in the community and <strong>Unity</strong> has formed due to how vague the price payout
                is</p>
        <h1>Pros:</h1>
        <p>-It has everything to let you create your game from scratch</p>
        <p>-Great tool for prototyping everything from games, to interactive visualizations</p>
        <p>-Allows you to import game assets and write codes</p>
        <p>-Allows you to develop games, animations, AR, VR, UI System, Particle systems, etc.</p>
        <p>-You only have to build it once and then you can deploy anywhere!</p>
