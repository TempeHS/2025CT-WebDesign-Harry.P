        <p>Due to the recent payout changes, <strong>Unity</strong> has fallen from being a reliable game engine</p>
        <p>Now, people are debating who will be a better substitude for <strong>Unity</strong></p>
        <p>Me personally, <strong>Godot</strong> has been a great starter engine for newbies like me.</p>
        <p>However, <strong>Unreal</strong> is also a great engine </p>
        <p>In this blog, we discuss on which game engine is going to be the best overall and part their history</p>

                </em></h2>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Unity</strong> has been around since the 8th of June, 2005,
                aiming to "democratize" game development by making it accessible to more developers.</p>
        <p>It was shown at Worldwide Developers Conference 2005 by Scott Forstall on Mac OS X.</p>
        <p>The following year, Unity was named runner-up in the Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category in Apple Inc's
                Apple Design Awards.</p>
        <p>Initially released for Mac OS X, <strong>Unity</strong> was later adding support for Microsoft Windows and
                Web browsers</p>
        <p>Since its release,<strong>Unity</strong> has had multiple versions to keep up with the bugs found.</p>
        <p>So with such a rich history, why do people no longer trust it?</p>
        <p><strong>Simple. The new payout plan</strong></p>

        <p>Now, a huge distrust in the community and <strong>Unity</strong> has formed due to how vague the price
                payoutis</p>
